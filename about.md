My name is Kaysan Merchant.

I am a student at Port Credit Secondary School(exp. 2027), apart of the SciTech program. I am of South Asian descent, specifically Pakistan. 

### My Heritage

I was born and raised in Canada, but as a Pakistani man, I became apart of a **Shi'a Nizari Ismaili** family. This is a group of muslims apart of the two main branches, Shi'a and Sunni.
